  <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Legends:_Arceus">Pokemon Legends: Arceus</a></h4>
   <p style="color:red; background-color:powderblue;""><b>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</b> (PLA) takes the general Pokemon formula we've come to know and love, crumples it into a 
nice paper ball and throws into the waste basket across the room.</p> 
   <p>PLA introduces a new Pokemon formula that is very reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter">Monster Hunter</a>. There's a base village where you 
can pick up sidequests and check your equipment, whether it be you current party of Pokemon, your usable items, or simply
your appearance. While there is no armor, per se, there is a clothing shop where you can change the hat, shirt, pants,
and maybe one more article of clothing on your character. It doesn't have much depth to it actually.</p>
   <p>Once you've decided to leave the village, you walk up to the gate and choose an area to go and explore. These areas
are decently sized, though a bit barren, and just like Monster Hunter you can walk around and catch Pokemon you see to your
heart's content. When you've had enough you can go back to one of the camps in the area and reqeust to go back, taking with
you all the spoils you've collected, including Pokemon, crafting materials, and other collectables.</p>
   <p>Overall the game is really worth it. It has <a href="images/paikcu.png">Pikachu</a>. There's all the incentive needed.</p><hr><br>

   <p>idk about this game honestly. Next!</p>
   <pre>
	It's open-world.	(But many objectives.)
	
	It has dinosaur robots. (Probably the best part.)

	It has a nice story.	(But the character never shuts up.)

   <p>Game of the Year. Nuff said.</p>
   <p>Here is a quote from Polygon about a cute moment in Elden Ring</p>

   <p>It's pretty good from what I've heard. Anyone hesitant on getting it simply because it's a Kirby game might be 
pleasantly surprised! At least, that's what I've heard.</p><hr><br>

   <p>A time-warp back to the old days where games included meaningful manuals. Half of your time in this game will be spent
in the menus looking at maps, clues, and instructions in the in-game manual. The loop of this game is basically walk around,
find a page of the manual, look at it, decipher what it's trying to tell you, go explore, find another page, open it, scratch
your head a lot, and keep exploring. It's masterfully done I would say, and when you figure out the puzzle that the game is
laying out in front of you, the sense of accomplishment is unlike any other rush of dopamine I've experienced in games. At 
least not in a long, long time.</p><hr>
